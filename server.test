SERVER irc.tost 1 4343 :Development server

NICK a 1 A localhost 4343 + B

TODO:

MODE, add prefix when broadcasting, also add the word MODE
also shouldn't have number?
(should be format:
:prefix MODE channelname modes
)
MODE crashes when coming from a server


NICK doesn't get correctly set when using server to server nick command

I should never receive & channel broadcast from server
I should never receive names command broadcast

error checking should only occur for local connections. Server broadcast conenctions should just do the thing. Therefore error checking on accepting a server should be good


delete connection from channel when user quits
move error checking from channels to actions
